### Pages Restructured
New structure:
```
/our_projects              → Categories grid with preview images
/our_projects/[category]   → Sites/projects grid with preview images
/our_projects/[category]/[site] → All images gallery
```

### Supporting Files
- `app/page.js` - Enhanced home page with hero, stats, and CTAs
- `app/about/page.jsx` - About page with company info
- `components/Nav.jsx` - Responsive navigation
- `components/Footer.jsx` - Footer with links and contact info

## Flow
1. Visit `/our_projects` → See 4 categories (Commercial, Residential, Hospitality, Healthcare) with preview images
2. Click a category → See all projects in that category with preview images
3. Click a project → See all images in a grid gallery

## Run Development Server
```bash
cd /Users/fehdi/Desktop/kazico
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/our_projects to see the new structure.
